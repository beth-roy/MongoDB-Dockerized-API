# MongoDB-Dockerized-API
This is a simple server built with Node.js and Express that connects to a MongoDB database running in a Docker container. The API allows you to start, stop and check the status of the MongoDB container, as well as retrieve and create user data stored in a MongoDB collection named 'users'.
